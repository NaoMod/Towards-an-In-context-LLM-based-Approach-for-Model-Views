I want to show a combination of 3 different metamodels that were created around the same application, a Trip-planning app.
The 3 metamodels are:
The TOGAF metamodel from the Enterprise Application is used by models representing the entire application architecture.
The ReqIF metamodel for the requirements of my application.
The BPMN model is used to represent the application processes.
The combination should represent all the most relevant information from each metamodel, considering the type of application.
