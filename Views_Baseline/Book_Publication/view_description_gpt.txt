Youâ€™re working with two data sets: one for Publication, which contains general information like the publisher and release date, and one for Chapter, which includes detailed information about chapters of books.

Your goal is to create a unified view where:

All chapters are linked to the corresponding publication, providing an overview of all the chapters associated with each publication.
The first chapter of each book is explicitly highlighted and linked to the corresponding publication in a distinct relation.

This ensures that the view includes two specific relationships: one that captures the connection between all chapters and their publications, and another that focuses exclusively on the first chapter and its publication.
