You’re working with two data sets: one for Publication, which contains general information like the publisher and release date, and one for Book, which provides details about books and their chapters. 
Your goal is to combine this information into a single output so that you can access both publication details together with the title of each chapter. 
To do this, you’ll retrieve all relevant fields from the Publication data, then link it to the Chapter data by connecting the chapters to the publication based on matching titles. 
You’ll need to find both the first chapter of each book that match the publication title and all its chapters, allowing you to view both summary and detailed book information in relation to the publication.
