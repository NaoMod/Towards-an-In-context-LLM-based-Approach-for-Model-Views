"The BibTeXML to DocBook example describes a transformation of a BibTeXML model to a DocBook composed document. BibTeXML is an XML-based format for the BibTeX bibliographic tool.
DocBook, as for it, is an XML-based format for document composition. The aim of this transformation is to generate, from a BibTeXML file, a DocBook document that presents the different entries of the bibliographic file within four different sections. The first section
provides the full list of bibliographic entries. The second section provides the sorted list of the different authors referenced in the bibliography. The third section presents the titles of the bibliography titled
entries (in a sorted way). Finally, the last section provides the list of referenced journals (in article entries).",BibTeX.ecore,DocBook.ecore
