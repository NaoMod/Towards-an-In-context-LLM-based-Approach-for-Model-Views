### EA_Application View

This is a adapted view from the the first EMF paper[1].

It is used to show a combination of 3 different models that was created around the same application (Trip planning app).
The 3 models are a TOGAF model from the Enterprise Application, a ReqIF model for the requirements and a BPMN model that shows a simple booking proccess.

This is an adapted version, since the one presented ion the paper used a old version of the tool.

Below is a screenshot of the final View in the MoDisco browser.
